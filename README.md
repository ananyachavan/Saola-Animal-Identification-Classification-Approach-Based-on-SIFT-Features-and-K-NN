# Saola-Animal-Identification-Classification-Approach-Based-on-SIFT-Features-and-K-NN
Wildlife species detection &amp; classification using K-NN model trained on SIFT features. Aim is efficient Saola &amp; Zebra identification
## Overview

The project employs the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for feature extraction from images, which are then used to train a K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) classifier. The K-NN model is trained on a small dataset of Saola and Zebra images to achieve accurate classification.

## Features

- Utilizes SIFT for robust feature extraction.
- Implements a K-NN classifier for efficient classification.
- Dataset includes limited images of Saola and Zebra species.
- Aimed at wildlife conservation and ecological research.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install necessary dependencies.
3. Run the feature extraction and training scripts.
4. Test the trained model with new images.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
